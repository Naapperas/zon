## [2.0.0] - 2024-06-20

### Changed

### Added

- Added `zon.traits` module for common functionality that is specific to no validator.
- Added the `zon.traits.collection` file which contains the `ZonCollection` class: this is the base class for all collection types.
- Added testing for `ZonCollection` and added more tests for `ZonString`.
- Scripts that automate the building and publishing of the package to PyPI.
- Added `refine` method to the base `Zon` class.

### Changed
- `ZonString` now inherits from `ZonCollection` instead of `Zon`.
- `ZonList` now inherits from `ZonCollection` instead of `Zon`.
- Updated `README.md` to include more information and examples of code usage.
  
### Removed
- Removed the `len` function from `ZonString` and `ZonList` as it was not being used and did too much.
